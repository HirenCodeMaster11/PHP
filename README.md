<h2 align="center">1. PHP Insertion in Database in Basic Form </h2>

#### 1.HTML Form: The code includes an HTML form with input fields (e.g., name, email, password) that sends data to a PHP script (insert.php) using the POST method.

#### 2.Database Connection: The PHP script connects to a MySQL database using the mysqli extension with parameters like host, username, password, and database name.

#### 3.Data Retrieval: Form data is collected via $_POST and stored in PHP variables for processing.

#### 4.Data Insertion: An SQL INSERT query is executed to add the form data to a database table (e.g., users).

#### 5.Response Handling: The script displays success or error messages based on the query result and closes the database connection.

<h2 align="center">2. READ & DELETE & BOOTSTRAP IN PHP </h2>

This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in PHP using Bootstrap for styling. It features a fully functional web application where users can add, view, update, and delete records from a database. The backend is powered by PHP, while MySQL is used as the database management system. The interface is styled with Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness and a user-friendly design.

The project is structured into separate files for clarity and maintainability. The config.php file handles database connectivity, while index.php serves as the main page to display records in a styled table. Other pages like add.php, update.php, and delete.php manage specific operations. The database setup is simplified with an included SQL file (database.sql), which can be easily imported to initialize the required table.

Users can clone this repository to set up the project locally or deploy it on a web server. After configuring the database credentials in config.php, the application will be ready to use. This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn PHP and Bootstrap or as a quick starter template for CRUD applications.
